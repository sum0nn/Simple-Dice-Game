Interactive Dice Game in a Website: with Dark Mode Comfort. 

Here's the link of my Website:
    https://sum0nn.github.io/Simple-Dice-Game/

Upon each webpage reload, a player achieves victory, with the victor determined by the highest dice number rolled. In the event of a tie, the outcome is considered a draw. Notably, this website incorporates a convenient dark mode functionality. Once activated and subsequently refreshed, the dark mode remains in effect until manually disabled.
